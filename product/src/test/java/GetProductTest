Goal:
 Create endpoint that takes in a String qrCode and returns a DTO with manufacturer, model and type

 Other considerations:
   a. A new property is needed on the entity, qrCode
   b. A new column is needed in the DB qr_code
   c. The new DB column needs to have a unique code => hephaestus-washing-machine-001 (project-module-number)
   d. Flyway needs to do the above changes for DB
